nuker-v2 was a 100% and user friendly tool that would "Nuke" servers,not only was it free but it allowed you to use custom bots,and customize channel,server and role names.
it was deleted due to false detections,specifically it was detected as a trojan,idk why.
another reason was that it posed a threat to my discord server and accounts.
